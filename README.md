### 📚 Commands Explained

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `git clone https://github.com/saifmalkurdi/dev-diary.git` | Clones the GitHub repo into my current directory |
| `ls` | Lists files and folders in the current path |
| `cd .\dev-diary\` | Changes into the `dev-diary` folder |
| `code .` | Opens the current folder in Visual Studio Code |

### 📘 What I Learned from the Terminal Command Cheat Sheet

- `pwd`: Shows the current working directory (important for knowing where I am).
- `ls`: Lists all files and folders — helps visualize folder structure.
- `cd`: Lets me move between folders (e.g., into a project).
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen for better visibility.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `touch` / `New-Item`: Creates new files quickly.
- `rm` / `del`: Removes files (careful!).
- `git clone`: Copies a GitHub repository to my local machine.
- `code .`: Opens current directory in Visual Studio Code.
